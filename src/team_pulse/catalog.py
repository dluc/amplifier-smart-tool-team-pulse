"""The one description of every capability, for every surface.

A capability is described in exactly one place -- here -- and the CLI, the
library's `capabilities()`/manifest, the Amplifier adapter and `ask_local`'s
model loop all derive from it. Nothing restates a name or a description.

That is the point of this module. The same capability used to carry three
different names and three different descriptions depending on which surface a
caller arrived through, so what a model was told about `search` depended on how
it found it. A caller that discovers a tool one way and invokes it another must
not get two different stories.

Descriptions are the bundle's, verbatim, wherever the bundle has a counterpart.
Each deviation is marked DEVIATION with the fact that forces it.

Names carry the `team_pulse_` prefix on model-facing surfaces because the bare
words -- search, prefix, graph, answer, get -- are also ordinary English, and
appear as ordinary English inside these very descriptions. The CLI and the
library get the bare verb, where the command name (`team-pulse search`) and the
module (`team_pulse.search`) already supply that separation.
