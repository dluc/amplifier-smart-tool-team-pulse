"""team-pulse: Team Pulse lens API as structured data, plus a model-backed answer.

The library is the tool: every capability is a function importable from here.
The CLI (`team_pulse.cli`) and the Amplifier module adapter
(`amplifier_module_tool_team_pulse`) marshal arguments and shape errors ONLY --
zero domain logic in either wrapper.

Credentials are read at CALL time, never at import time: `import team_pulse`
succeeds with a completely empty environment.

`team_pulse.client`, `.config`, `.auth`, `.models`, and `.errors` are the
standalone async client library for the Team Pulse lens API (see the module
docstrings in each for details). Everything else here -- `api`, `model`,
`ask_local`, `prompts`, `manifest`, `cli` -- is this distribution's own bounded
loop and adapters built on top of that client.
