"""Model-backed `answer()` capability -- the retrieval loop over the client.

The retrieval-strategy prose (`prompts/retrieval-strategy.md`, shipped
verbatim) is used directly as the system prompt for a native tool-calling
loop this distribution owns.

The model decides when to stop, exactly as it did when this ran inside an
agent runtime: it keeps calling `search`/`get` until it calls `answer`. There
is no step budget. Tool names and arguments are validated by the provider
against the schemas below, so an unparseable response or an unknown action is
not a state this loop can reach -- which is what a step budget was previously
compensating for.

`answer()` returns what the model produced: its answer, and the citations it
gave. The model is trusted to cite, as it was when this ran inside an agent
runtime -- this loop adds no validation of its own.

    The model drives the retrieval with native tool calls and decides when it

    Both preconditions are checked FIRST, before any model call, so a caller
